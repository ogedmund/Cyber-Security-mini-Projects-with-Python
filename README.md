# Python-Cybersecurity
A few projects using python for cybersecurity.

1. Password Generator with Tkinter and random modules
2. Simple Port-Scanner 
3. Subdomain Enumeration - Finding subdomains used by the target organization is an effective way to increase the attack surface and discover more vulnerabilities. The script will use a list of potential subdomains and prepends them to the domain name provided via a command-line argument. The script then tries to connect to the subdomains and assumes the ones that accept the connection exist. The subdomains.txt should be in the same directory as the Python script. It can also be done with DNS. A function that can be used to get input from the command line is sys.argv()

4. Directory Enumeration - Reconnaissance is one of the most critical steps to the success of a penetration testing engagement. This code builds a simple directory enumeration tool. 

I also completed a few other projects via LetesDefend.io (an amazing platform for learning cybersecurity) - Web Scrapping with Python, Port Scanner, IDS,FIM, Forensic and Incident Response.


Looking forward to add some additional projects on the following

Use DNS requests to enumerate potential subdomains
Build the keylogger to send the capture keystrokes to a server you built using Python
Grab the banner of services running on open ports
Crawl the target website to download .js library files included
Try to build a Windows executable for each and see if they work as stand-alone applications on a Windows target
Implement threading in enumeration and brute-forcing scripts to make them run faster
